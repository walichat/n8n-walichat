## Configuring n8n Webhooks for External Access

To receive events from WaliChat or other external services, you'll need to configure n8n with a publicly accessible URL. By default, n8n runs locally and generates webhook URLs using localhost, which external services cannot reach.

#### Understanding Webhook Configuration

n8n creates webhook URLs by combining the protocol, host, and port settings. When running behind a reverse proxy or needing public access, you must manually set the webhook URL.

#### Setting the Webhook URL

##### Temporary Configuration (Session Only)

###### Mac / Linux

```bash
export WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com/
n8n start
```

###### Windows (Command Prompt)

```cmd
set WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com/
n8n start
```

###### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:WEBHOOK_URL = "https://your-domain.com/"
n8n start
```

##### Permanent Configuration

###### Mac / Linux

Add to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or appropriate shell configuration file:
```bash
echo 'export WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com/' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

###### Windows

Set a system environment variable through:
1. Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' â†’ Properties
2. Click 'Advanced system settings'
3. Click 'Environment Variables'
4. Add a new system variable with:
   - Name: `WEBHOOK_URL`
   - Value: `https://your-domain.com/`

#### Verifying Your Webhook Configuration

1. Start n8n after setting the webhook URL
2. Create a new workflow and add an "WaliChat" node that uses webhooks
3. The webhook URL should now show your custom domain instead of localhost
4. External services can now successfully send events to your n8n instance

> **Note**: Ensure your domain is properly set up with SSL and that your network/firewall allows incoming connections to the port your n8n instance is using.

### Using ngrok for Public Webhook URLs

If you're developing locally and need a quick way to expose your n8n instance to the internet for testing webhooks, [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is a great solution.

#### Installing ngrok

##### Mac

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install ngrok
```

[Or download and install manually here](https://ngrok.com/downloads/mac-os)

##### Linux

[Follow the instructions described here](https://ngrok.com/downloads/linux?tab=install)

##### Windows

1. Download ngrok from [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)
2. Extract the zip file
3. Optionally, add the ngrok executable to your PATH or move it to a directory that's already in your PATH

[Alternatively follow the instructions here](https://ngrok.com/downloads/windows)

#### Setting Up ngrok

1. Sign up for a free account at [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)
2. Get your auth token from the ngrok dashboard
3. Configure ngrok with your auth token:
   ```bash
   ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

#### Using ngrok with n8n

1. Start your n8n instance first:
   ```bash
   n8n start
   ```

2. In a new terminal window, start ngrok pointing to n8n's default port:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5678
   ```

3. Ngrok will display a URL like `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

4. Set this as your n8n webhook URL in a new terminal:

   Mac/Linux:
   ```bash
   export WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io/
   n8n start
   ```

   Windows (Command Prompt):
   ```cmd
   set WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io/
   n8n start
   ```

   Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   $env:WEBHOOK_URL = "https://abc123.ngrok.io/"
   n8n start
   ```

5. You'll need to restart n8n for the webhook URL changes to take effect

#### Example Workflow

1. Start n8n on port 5678
2. Launch ngrok: `ngrok http 5678`
3. Note the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
4. Stop n8n
5. Set the webhook URL environment variable with the ngrok URL
6. Restart n8n
7. Create a workflow with a WaliChat webhook trigger
8. The webhook URL will now use your ngrok domain and be accessible from the internet

> **Note**: Free ngrok sessions expire after a few hours and the URL changes each time you restart ngrok. For production use, consider a permanent solution like a proper domain with a reverse proxy.
